# 🦹‍♀️ Supervillains Validation Demo

Welcome to the **Supervillains Demo Project**, where evil plans meet clean code!  
This is a small Spring Boot application created to demonstrate **Java Bean Validation** in both **Entities** and **DTOs**, using a fun supervillain theme.

> 💡 This project was built for a class demonstration on how to implement and use validation in a real-world Spring Boot app.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Bean Validation using Jakarta Validation (`@NotBlank`, `@Min`, `@Email`, etc.)
- ✅ Automatic validation in controllers with `@Valid`
- ✅ Validation in both:
    - 📦 **DTOs** (user input validation)
    - 🧬 **Entities** (data integrity at persistence level)
- ✅ Custom validation messages
- ✅ Global exception handling for validation errors
- 🦹‍♂️ Supervillain-themed data and structure for a fun learning experience
